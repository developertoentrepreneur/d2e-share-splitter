        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Welcome to the Share Splitter project, a tool to help you and your team split your company shares
            dynamically!
        </p>
        <p>At DevelopperToEntrepreneur, we aim at giving you free tools such as this one, so we hope you enjoy it :)
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4> a. The pain</h4>
        <br>
        <p>When starting a project, it is never easy to define within a team the shares distribution. You may think that
            you
            deserve more because of your expertise, because of your connections or any other valid reason.
        </p>
        <p>Most probably same will happen with other team members. Therefore, there is a need of a fair system to
            distribute
            shares.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4> b. The solution</h4>
        <br>
        <p>There are many solutions to fairly distribute shares amongst your team members. The one proposed in this
            project is based on the fact that shares distribution should never be fixed in time.
        </p>
        <p>Indeed, it makes more sense to distribute the shares according to each team member contributions. Each
            contribution should have its own value depending on the contribution type.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. How to use it</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Share Splitter is the tool to facilitate you splitting shares dynamically within your team. It is composed of
            three main components: a project, users and contributions
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4> a. Projects</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Once you have managed to install Share Splitter, you first need a project to begin interacting with the tool.
            As of this version, a project has three main parameters:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name: The name of the project</li>
            <li>Cash multiplier: A value that will be used to compute the shares created out of expenses contributions
            </li>
            <li>Non cash multiplier: A value that will be used to compute the shares created out of timed contributions
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those parameters will be explained further in detail in the following sections</p>
        <br>
        <h4> b. Users</h4>
        <br>
        <p>By default an admin user is created so it's possible to interact with the platform. You can easily create new
            users through the users tab. Upon a user creation, the following parameters must be defined
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>username</li>
            <li>email</li>
            <li>job title </li>
            <li>job title </li>
            <li>year salary: it will be used to compute the shares for each contribution. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initially the amount of shares from a created user is 0. The moment he/she starts contributing the total
            shares will be the sum of all contributions he/she made </p>
        <br>
        <h4> c. Contributions</h4>
        <br>
        <p> A contribution is an action you or any team member did to add value to the project. For now there is only
            two types of contributions: time or money.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Timed contributions</h5>
        <p>A timed contribution is transformed into shares with the following formula:</p>
        <p><samp> hourly_rate = yearly_salary_of_a_user / 2000 </samp> </p>
        <p>(since it is considered that a regular employee works 2000h a
            year)
        </p>
        <p> <samp> shares = project_non_cash_multiplier * time_spent_on_project (in h) * hourly_rate</samp> </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Expenses contributions</h5>
        <p>A money contribution is transformed into shares with the following formula:</p>
        <p><samp>shares = project_cash_multiplier * amount_of_money</samp> </p>
        <br>
        <p>As you may have observed in the Share distribution tab, by the default the cash multiplier is higher than the
            non cash multiplier. This seems logical since you are investing real money in a project that may never see
            the light. </p>
        <p>However this is not fixed, and you can always change those values to the ones you define within your team</p>
        <br>
        <h4>d. Shares distribution </h4>
        <br>
        <p>The sum of all shares from the contributions makes the total shares the company has. Since each owner has
            it's own shares, the percentage of ownership of the project is actually the shares of the user divided by
            the total shares.</p>
        <p> You can actually see this distribution in the share distribution tab.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Share Splitter aims at helping any team in the initial phase of creating a startup.</p>
        <p>
            It helps the team to create a fair equity distribution determided by the engagement of each team member</p>
